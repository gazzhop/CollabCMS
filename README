CollabCMS

I want to create a community-built cms that has an intuitive GUI and a powerful backend. It will use PHP and MySQL as a base and incorporate jQuery and AJAX to provide a better user experience.

Folder Structure:

CollabCMS
-classes (hold all the required classes)
-images
-includes (navigation, header, footer, contributors)
-scripts
--jQuery
-userfiles
--images
--documents
--media
-styles
